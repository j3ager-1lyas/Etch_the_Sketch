A Table Board that you can draw on

I want this Website to use as many DOM Manipulations
as Possible.

The Website will Have a Board and a Set of Tools(A),
the later Use is to give the client variant ways of how to Draw.
The Table Board Maximum amount of grids is 100*100
to make sure that nothing is very Slow, after all
the more grids the script needs to Generate the more
slow the drawing and Website will be.
The Tools bar will have :
    - Color palette.
    - Eraser.
    - Table Clear.
    - Rainbow(RandomPerGrid) Color.
    - Grid Size Control ( 16*16 ).
    - Darkening Button.
    - Lightening Button.
divded to two Tool Bars :
    1. Eraser .
     . Table Clear.
    2. Grid Size Control.
     . Color Palette.
     . Rainbow.
     . Darkening.
     . Lightening.
*The UI shall be simple and with Coloring that is
  neutral and from same Palette of cold light Colors.
*Only The Tools bar shall shrink a bit to an extent
 if the window has been minimzed.
*The Click and Data goes from the UI to the JS,
 which changes the styling and the format of the UI.
